<section class="overview-box">

* ***Primary Text:*** Matthew 10:17; Matthew 20:19; John 19:1
* ***Supporting Text:*** Deuteronomy 25:3; 1 Kings 12:11; Hebrews 12:6; 2 Corinthians 11:24
* ***Theme:*** The word “scourge” in Scripture functions as an umbrella term. Its severity depends on context—Jewish discipline, Roman punishment, or metaphorical divine chastening. Understanding the setting prevents overstatement or understatement of the text.
* ***Audience:*** Small, engaged Southern Baptist congregation rooted in traditional dispensational beliefs, with cultural sensitivity to a rural Black church context.

### **Introduction**

When we read the word *“scourge”* in our English Bible, we must not assume it always refers to the same instrument or level of brutality.

In Scripture, the meaning shifts depending on:

1. **Who is administering the punishment**
2. **Under what legal authority it occurs**
3. **Whether the language is literal or figurative**

By examining both Old and New Testament usage, we can interpret passages—especially in the Gospels—with greater precision and theological care.

# I. WHAT DOES “SCOURGE” MEAN?

In both Testaments, *scourge* can refer to:

1. A basic whip
2. A formal judicial flogging
3. A severe Roman torture instrument
4. A metaphor for divine judgment or calamity

The word itself does **not automatically specify** the instrument.
Context determines severity.

# II. OLD TESTAMENT USAGE (Hebrew Terms)

## 1️⃣ שׁוֹט (šōṭ) — “Whip / Scourge”

**Basic meaning:** whip, lash, scourge.
May be literal or figurative.

### Literal Example

📖 1 Kings 12:11 — Rehoboam:

> “My father chastised you with whips…”

This refers to an ordinary lash.

### Figurative Example

📖 Isaiah 10:26
📖 Job 9:23

Here “scourge” represents calamity or divine judgment.

👉 The Hebrew word does not describe construction details—only the act of striking.

---

## 2️⃣ “Scorpions” — עַקְרָב (‘aqrāv) 🦂 

Rehoboam escalates punishment:

> “My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”
> — 1 Kings 12:11

Likely meaning: a whip enhanced with metal barbs or sharp fragments.

The point: **increased severity.**

Even in the Old Testament we see escalation:

* Ordinary whip
* Barbed scourge
* Figurative divine judgment

---

# III. NEW TESTAMENT GREEK TERMS

## 1️⃣ μάστιξ (mastix) — whip / scourge

## 2️⃣ μαστιγόω (mastigoō) — to scourge / flog

These Greek terms:

* Do not define the instrument type
* Can refer to Jewish or Roman practice
* Can be literal or metaphorical

Therefore, we must examine historical context.

# IV. JEWISH SCOURGING (Synagogue Discipline)

### Governed by Deuteronomy 25:3

Maximum: 40 lashes
Practice: 39 lashes (“forty minus one”)

📖 2 Corinthians 11:24 — Paul received this punishment five times.

This is the scourging warned about by **Jesus Christ** in:

📖 Matthew 10:17
📖 Matthew 23:34

### Characteristics:

* Three-thonged leather whip
* Regulated number of lashes
* Severe but controlled
* Not normally fatal

When Jesus speaks of believers being scourged in synagogues, this regulated discipline is the background.

---

# V. ROMAN SCOURGING (Flagrum / Flagellum)

![Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Cimabue_-_Flagellation.jpg)

Used by Roman authorities, including under **Pontius Pilate**.

### Passion Predictions

📖 Matthew 20:19
📖 Mark 10:34
📖 Luke 18:33

### Fulfillment

📖 John 19:1 — “Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.”

### Characteristics:

* Multiple leather straps
* Embedded bone or metal
* Tore flesh deeply
* Sometimes fatal
* Often preceded crucifixion

When Jesus predicted He would be scourged by Gentiles, this Roman-level brutality is implied.

---

# VI. FIGURATIVE NEW TESTAMENT USE

📖 Hebrews 12:6

> “Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.”

Here the term is metaphorical:

* Covenant discipline
* Spiritual correction
* Not physical torture

The author uses strong imagery to communicate seriousness—not literal whipping.

---

# VII. WHY THIS DISTINCTION MATTERS (SEMBC CONTEXT)

1. The English word alone does not determine severity.
2. Authority determines instrument:

   * Jewish authority → synagogue lash
   * Roman authority → flagrum
3. Passion narratives imply extreme brutality.
4. Figurative uses describe divine discipline, not torture.

Careful interpretation protects us from exaggeration on one hand or minimizing suffering on the other.

# IX. KEY TAKEAWAY FOR SUNDAY SCHOOL

Whenever we see “scourge,” we should ask:

1. Who is administering the punishment?
2. Under what legal authority?
3. Is the language literal or figurative?
4. Does the passage specify Gentiles, synagogues, or divine discipline?

Correct interpretation begins with context.
