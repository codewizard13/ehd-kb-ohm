## 📖🔥 **“THE KINGDOM IS HERE” — What Did Jesus Mean?**

<section class="overview-box">

* ***Primary Text:*** Luke 17:20–21
* ***Supporting Text:*** Matthew 4:17; Matthew 12:28; Romans 14:17; Revelation 11:15
* ***Theme:*** Is the Kingdom of God present now, or only future? Scripture reveals both a present spiritual reality and a future visible reign. Understanding this distinction helps us avoid extremes while remaining faithful to the biblical text.
* ***Audience:*** Small, engaged Southern Baptist congregation rooted in traditional dispensational beliefs, with cultural sensitivity to a rural Black church context.

### **Introduction**

When Jesus declared, “The kingdom of God is at hand,” He introduced one of the most important themes of the New Testament. Some believers teach that the Kingdom is entirely future. Others insist that because Christians exist, the Kingdom is fully here now.

So which is it?

By examining the words of **Jesus Christ** and the broader testimony of Scripture, we see that the Kingdom is both **already present spiritually** and **not yet fully manifested physically**.

## I. WHAT IS “THE KINGDOM OF GOD”?

The Kingdom is not primarily geography.
It is **God’s rule and reign**.

📖 **Romans 14:17**

> “For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.”

The Kingdom =

* God’s authority
* God’s rule
* God’s will being done

---

## II. JESUS ANNOUNCED A PRESENT KINGDOM

### 1️⃣ “At Hand” — Matthew 4:17

> “Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”

“At hand” means **near, approaching, within reach**.

### 2️⃣ “The Kingdom Has Come” — Matthew 12:28

> “If I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.”

Here, Jesus connects Kingdom arrival with:

* Deliverance
* Authority over demons
* The Spirit’s power

### 3️⃣ Luke 17:21 — “Within You”

> “The kingdom of God is within you.”

In context, Jesus is speaking to Pharisees. The phrase can also mean:

* “In your midst”
* “Among you”

Meaning: **The King was standing in front of them.**

Where the King is, the Kingdom is present.

## III. BUT THE KINGDOM IS ALSO FUTURE

### Revelation 11:15

> “The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ…”

This clearly describes a future global manifestation.

### The Disciples Asked

📖 Acts 1:6

> “Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?”

Even after the resurrection, there was still an expected future fulfillment.

## IV. “ALREADY / NOT YET” FRAMEWORK

The New Testament presents a tension:

| Aspect      | Present Reality                  | Future Fulfillment         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Authority   | Christ rules in believers        | Christ rules the nations   |
| Power       | Spirit defeats darkness          | Satan fully removed        |
| Citizenship | Believers transferred (Col 1:13) | Earth fully transformed    |
| Peace       | Spiritual peace now              | Global peace under Messiah |

We live in the overlap of the ages.

Theologians sometimes call this “inaugurated Kingdom.”

## V. VISUAL: KINGDOM PARABLE IMAGERY

### 🌱 Mustard Seed (Matthew 13:31–32)

Starts small → grows large.
Begins quietly → expands visibly.

### 🍞 Leaven in Dough (Matthew 13:33)

Hidden → working internally → eventually affects the whole.

These parables show:

* A beginning phase
* A growth phase
* A future fullness

## VI. SEMBC CONTEXT: WHY THIS MATTERS

Within a dispensational framework, we affirm:

1. Israel still has prophetic promises yet to be fulfilled.
2. Christ’s earthly millennial reign is future (Revelation 20).
3. The Church does not replace Israel.

Yet we also affirm:

* Christ is reigning at the Father’s right hand now.
* Believers operate under Kingdom authority now.
* The Holy Spirit is evidence of present Kingdom reality.

The Kingdom is not postponed into nonexistence.
Nor is it fully realized politically today.

It is present spiritually and future physically.

## VII. SUMMARY TABLE

| Question                        | Biblical Answer                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Is the Kingdom here?            | Yes — spiritually present        |
| Is the Kingdom future?          | Yes — visibly and politically    |
| Does the Church replace Israel? | No                               |
| Does Christ reign now?          | Yes — at the Father’s right hand |
| Will Christ reign on earth?     | Yes — future fulfillment         |

---

## VIII. KEY TAKEAWAY FOR SEMBC

When someone says, “The Kingdom is here,” we ask:

1. In what sense? (Spiritual or political?)
2. Is the King acknowledged?
3. Is Scripture distinguishing present power from future glory?

Balanced conclusion:

> The King has come.
> The Kingdom has begun.
> The fullness is still coming.

We live between announcement and consummation.
